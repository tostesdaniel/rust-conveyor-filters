            Hey there! I&apos;m Daniel, also known as <strong>ohTostt</strong>{" "}
            in the gaming world. With over{" "}
            <strong>{gameHours || "too many"}</strong> hours in Rust, I came to
            a conclusion that I&apos;ve spent too much time setting up filters
            than actually playing the game. That&apos;s when the idea of{" "}
            <strong>Rust Conveyor Filters</strong> was born.

          <Typography variant='p' className='text-lg leading-8'>
            What started as an idea to help myself save time, quickly turned
            into something greater. I shared it with my friends and they loved
            it! With their feedback, I was able to improve the app and make it
            better before sharing it with the community.

            My favorite part about this project is the community. I&apos;ve
            received so much support and it&apos;s been a great experience to be
            a part of it. Also, the idea of turning this idea into a reality is
            something that I&apos;m really proud of, and it reignited my passion
            for programming.

            As for Rust, I still play it, but not as much as I used to. Usually
            I hop on for a day to snowball with my friends and have a good time.
            As a developer, my goal is to make this app better each day, with
            the help of this community that supported it from the start. Thank
            you all! ❤️
