# Rust Conveyor Filters - Items Sink Directory

from Rust game updates before processing and integrating them into the database.

## Purpose

- Processed by the update-items.ts script
- Files here are compared against existing items
- New items are added, existing items are updated

1. Place new item JSON files in this directory
2. Run the update script: `bun update-items`
3. The script will process these files and update the database
